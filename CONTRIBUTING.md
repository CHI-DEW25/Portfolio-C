🧑‍💻 How to Contribute

Thank you for considering contributing to Portfolio-C! This project welcomes improvements of all kinds—bug fixes, new features, design refinements, documentation updates, or general cleanup. Before you begin, please ensure that any changes stay consistent with the style and purpose of this portfolio: clean, readable, lightweight, and beginner-friendly. When contributing, start by forking the repository, creating a new branch with a descriptive name, and making your changes cleanly and clearly. Once you’re ready, submit a pull request that explains exactly what you changed and why, ideally referencing any issues your contribution addresses. All contributions should follow respectful communication, clear commit messages, and maintainable code structure.

To keep the project stable and easy to grow, contributors should always format HTML consistently, write clean and well-commented CSS, and ensure JavaScript additions are efficient and non-intrusive. Avoid adding unnecessary libraries or heavy dependencies, and keep all assets neatly organized inside the assets/ folder. If your contribution affects visuals or interactivity, please test your changes across multiple screen sizes to confirm responsiveness. Remember that all contributions fall under the project’s open-source LICENSE, and by submitting a pull request you agree to those terms. If you’re ever unsure, feel free to open an issue first—discussion is always welcome. Thank you for helping improve the project!
